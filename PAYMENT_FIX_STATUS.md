## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Fixes / Recommendations

1. **Babel Configuration Issues**
   The main issue revolves around the Babel configuration and specifically the `babel-preset-expo` dependency.

   Recommended solutions:
   
   a. **Remove Expo Dependency**
      If your project doesn't require Expo, simplify the Babel configuration:
      ```js
      // babel.config.js
      module.exports = {
        presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
      };
      ```
   
   b. **Install Expo Properly**
      If you need Expo functionality:
      ```bash
      npm install --save-dev expo expo-cli babel-preset-expo
      ```

   c. **Use Create React App Configuration**
      If using Create React App, remove custom Babel configuration and rely on the built-in configuration.

2. **ESLint Integration**
   The ESLint configuration has been simplified to avoid Babel dependency issues. If you need advanced ESLint features with Babel integration, follow these steps after resolving the Babel issues:
   
   ```json
   // .eslintrc.json with Babel support
   {
     "extends": ["react-app"],
     "parser": "@babel/eslint-parser",
     "parserOptions": {
       "requireConfigFile": false,
       "babelOptions": {
         "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
       }
     },
     "rules": {
       "jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid": "warn"
     }
   }
   ```

## üõë Known Issues

1. **Babel Parsing Errors**
   There are still parsing errors related to the `babel-preset-expo` dependency. This could be caused by:
   
   - A mismatch between the installed version and what's expected
   - Conflicts between different Babel configurations
   - Incorrect import chains in node_modules
   
   The best solution may be to:
   
   1. Remove node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules`
   2. Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
   3. Reinstall dependencies: `npm install`
   4. If using Expo, reinstall specifically: `npm install --save-dev expo babel-preset-expo`

2. **Firebase Integration**
   While the scripts are now properly formatted, you should still verify that the Firebase integration with the payment system works as expected.

## üìã Testing Checklist

Once the Babel issues are resolved, test the payment system with:

1. ‚úì Run `./test-payment-system.sh` to verify configuration
2. ‚úì Run `./test-payment-api.sh` to test API endpoints
3. ‚úì Run `./test-payment-logging.sh` to test logging
4. ‚úì Start the server with `node server.js` and try a test payment

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. Resolve the Babel configuration issues using one of the recommended approaches
2. Update the .env file with actual test credentials
3. Complete a full test payment flow
4. Once everything is working in testing, prepare for production deployment
